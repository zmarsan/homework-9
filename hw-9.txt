#1 What is SQL? What are relational databases?

SQL stands for a structured query language, and it is the standard for database creation and manipulation.
A relational database is a database that uses structures like tables, rows, and columns, to access data in relation to other data in that same database.

#2 What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?

PDOs help manage the connection to the database, running queries through it. 
We need to use prepared statements because they can help guard against hacks - running escaping functions on your code and parameters.
